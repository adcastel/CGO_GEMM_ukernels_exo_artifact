C test for performing microkernels over ARMv8 processors

Current supported microkernels
- BLIS  -> (need BLIS v0.9 from https://github.com/flame/blis) Assembly micro-kernel
- QBLIS -> Neon intrinsic base Microkernel
- EXO   -> Automathic generated micro-kernel with the Exo tool (uk.* files)  

How to use:

make
./test_uk_blis OPT MR NR KC_I KC_E KC_S T E 

where.

- OPT admit: BLIS or QBLIS or EXO  
- MR is the M dimension of C
- NR is the N dimension of C
- KC_I is the initial K value of dimension of A and B 
- KC_E is the end K value of dimension of A and B 
- KC_S is the step of the K value of dimension of A and B 
- T is the minimum time of execution
- E id for checking error or not (T|E)
