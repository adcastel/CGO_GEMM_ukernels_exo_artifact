#EXO ukr generator

This software generates automatically specialized C code for a given architecture with the EXO compiler.
Currently only ARM neon codes are available.

This software need the Exo with fp16 Neon intrinsics support that is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/exo-C106

#The directory is composed by:
- README       -> This file
- Makefile     -> The file that generates the microkernel and compiles the test
- main.c       -> The performance test
- base_ukr.py  -> The Python Exo file that generates the microkernel
- blis.py      -> The Python file that calls the micro-kernel generator


#How to use it
#First add the current directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH
make && ./uk
